## Epic Simplicity

1. **Easy-peasy:** No fuss, just a smooth start to bot development, so you can focus on crafting cool features.
2. **Built-in awesomeness:** Commands, events, plugins - it's all there, ready to create bots that pack a punch.

Robo.js brings the best of Discord.js, with added ease and pizzazz, helping you create bots that truly shine. ðŸŒŸ

## Usage

Crafting a simple Robo is a piece of cake! First, whip up a `/ping` command by creating a `ping.js` file in your `/src/commands` folder:

```javascript
export default () => {
	return 'Pong!'
}
```

Miss your interaction object? No worries, it's still got your back! Here's another example using `interaction.reply`:

```javascript
export default (interaction) => {
	interaction.reply('Pong!')
}
```

For events, say you want to listen to `messageCreate` events. Create a `messageCreate.js` file inside your `/src/events` folder:

```javascript
export default (message) => {
    if (message.content.includes('hello')) {
        message.channel.send('Hello there!');
    }
}
```

Robo.js will automatically handle the necessary permissions when you run `robo invite`.

### No Learning Curve

With Robo.js, there's practically no learning curve! As a framework for Discord.js, you'll still have access to everything Discord.js has to offer. ðŸŽ‰

To get your Robo grooving in development mode, bust out `robo dev` (or `npm run dev`). When you're all set to host your Robo, hit `robo build`, then kick things off with `robo start`. Don't forget to explore the [full documentation](/docs) for even more awesomeness! ðŸ”¥
