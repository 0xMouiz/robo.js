## Epic Simplicity

Robo.js dishes out Discord.js goodness with a focus on simplicity, making it easy-peasy to craft bots that truly sparkle â€“ all without compromises! ðŸŒŸ

- **Easy-peasy:** No fuss, just a smooth start to bot development, so you can focus on crafting cool features.
- **Built-in awesomeness:** Commands, events, plugins - it's all there, ready to create bots that pack a punch.
- **Sage's helping hand:** Sage simplifies command interaction and offers smart error replies, making debugging a breeze.
- **Customizable & scalable:** Adjust, grow, and adapt your bot as needed with Robo.js's flexibility.
- **Community power:** Tap into the know-how and support of the Discord.js community.

## Usage

Crafting a simple Robo is a piece of cake! First, whip up a `/ping` command by creating a `ping.js` file in your `/src/commands` folder:

```javascript
export default () => {
	return 'Pong!'
}
```

Miss your interaction object? No worries, it's still got your back! Here's another example using `interaction.reply`:

```javascript
export default (interaction) => {
	interaction.reply('Pong!')
}
```

For events, say you want to listen to `messageCreate` events. Create a `messageCreate.js` file inside your `/src/events` folder:

```javascript
export default (message) => {
    if (message.content.includes('hello')) {
        message.channel.send('Hello there!');
    }
}
```

Following the above examples, your file structure should look a lil' something like this:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ping.js
â””â”€â”€ events/
    â””â”€â”€ messageCreate.js
```

Robo.js will automatically handle the necessary permissions when you run `robo invite`.

### No Learning Curve

With Robo.js, there's practically no learning curve! As a framework for Discord.js, you'll still have access to everything Discord.js has to offer. ðŸŽ‰

To get your Robo grooving in development mode, bust out `robo dev` (or `npm run dev`). When you're all set to host your Robo, hit `robo build`, then kick things off with `robo start`. Don't forget to explore the [full documentation](/docs) for even more awesomeness! ðŸ”¥
