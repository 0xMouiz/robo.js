# Developing Overview

## Commands ðŸŽ®

With Robo.js, creating slash commands is a breeze! Simply add a file to the `commands` folder, and its name becomes your slash command. For example, if you want a `/ping` command, create a `ping.js` file inside the `commands` folder. Piece of cake!

## Events ðŸŽ‰

Events work similarly to commands! Create a file with the same name as the Discord event you want to listen to, and Robo.js will do the rest. For stacked events, use a directory named after the event and toss your event files inside. It's best to name stacked event files based on their purpose, like `dm.js` and `hello.js` under `messageCreate`.

## The Robo.js File Structure ðŸ“‚

In Robo.js, you'll want a `src` directory at the root with `commands` and `events` directories chillin' inside. The command file's name becomes the command name, and the event file's name transforms into the triggering event's name. Stack commands to whip up subcommands and use a directory with the same name as the event for stacked events.

Here's a little example of a Robo.js file structure for commands and events:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ping.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ settings/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ subcommand.js
â””â”€â”€ events/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ready.js
    â””â”€â”€ messageCreate/
        â””â”€â”€ dm.js
        â””â”€â”€ hello.js
```
