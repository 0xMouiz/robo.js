# TypeScript ðŸš€

TypeScript is like JavaScript's cooler cousin, ready to swoop in and save the day by catching those sneaky typos and helping you figure out what code exists. And guess what? It's super easy to learn, too! If you're already buds with JavaScript, hop on over to the [W3Schools TypeScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/) to kick things off!

Robo.js and TypeScript? They're BFFs. With first-class TypeScript support, you can say goodbye to setting up compiling or handling it yourself. Just stick to the `dev` and `build` commands, and you're golden. Plus, Robo.js uses the zippy Rust-based compiler, [SWC](https://swc.rs/), for a nice performance boost.

## Setting Up TypeScript Projects

Ready to roll? The `create-robo` CLI is here to kickstart your TypeScript projects without breaking a sweat:

```bash
npx create-robo my-awesome-robo --ts
```

For existing projects, just install `@swc/core` and `typescript` as dev dependencies, whip up a `tsconfig.json` file, and swap out those `.js` files for `.ts`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @swc/core typescript
```

Here's an example `tsconfig.json` file to get you started:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "lib": ["esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "incremental": true
  },
  "include": ["**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

## TypeScript Types in Robo.js

Robo.js was born and raised with TypeScript, so it's got native support for all those types. You'll run into common ones like `CommandConfig`, `EventConfig`, `CommandResult`, and `Config`, along with more advanced types like `Plugin` and `Manifest`. Check out this code example of an async Robo command with a custom export config object:

```typescript
import { CommandConfig, CommandResult } from "@roboplay/robo.js"

export const config: CommandConfig = {
  description: "An async example command"
}

export default async (): Promise<CommandResult> => {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
  return "Waited for 1 second."
}
```

Using TypeScript means you'll need types for interactions and other related objects. No worries, just import them straight from Discord.js! Here's an example:

```typescript
import { CommandInteraction } from "discord.js"

export default (interaction: CommandInteraction) => {
  interaction.reply("Hello, TypeScript!")
}
```

## Building Plugins with TypeScript

Why not build plugins with TypeScript? It's a match made in heaven for better type-safety and an awesome development experience. And the best part? The `robo build plugin` command already takes care of building plugins with TypeScript for you:

```bash
robo build plugin
```

## TypeScript in Config Files

Config files may be in JavaScript format, but TypeScript's still got your back! Just use `@type` annotation comments to harness its power. Editors like VS Code will support these annotations, giving you a smooth sail with autocompletion suggestions and type checking.

Here's an example of a config file with the GPT plugin:

```javascript
// @ts-check

/** @type {import('@roboplay/robo.js').Plugin} */
const gptPlugin = [
  "@roboplay/gpt",
  {
    // Your GPT plugin config options...
  }
]

/** @type {import('@roboplay/robo.js').Config} */
export default {
  // Your config options...
  plugins: [gptPlugin]
}
```

In this example, the `@ts-check` and `@type` annotation comments clue in the editor on the types for the variables below. You'll be treated to autocompletion suggestions and type checking as you code, making your code super readable and easy to maintain. ðŸŽ‰
